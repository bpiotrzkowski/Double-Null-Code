Double Null Algorithm-Evolution.ipynb creates numpy arrays for other codes to read (e.g. Numerical Analytic Comparsion.ipynb)

Double Null Algorithm-Complete.ipynb solves the spacetime and has its own analyzing code 

Both Analytical Solution codes simply solve for and display their respective spacetimes

Numerical Analytic Comparison.ipynb takes the numpy arrays from either of the Double Null codes and compares them with their analytical solution


Double_Null_utils.py contains the functions that the Double Null codes use

Boundary_Functions.py contains the functions that the Analytical codes use
