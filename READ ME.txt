Double Null Algorithm-Evolution.ipynb creates numpy arrays or hd5 files, depending on which version is chosen, for other codes to read (e.g. Numerical Analytic Comparsion.ipynb)

Both Analytical Solution codes simply solve for and display their respective spacetimes

Numerical Analytic Comparison.ipynb takes the arrays from either of the Double Null codes and compares them with their analytical solution

Mass-Scalar Field Analyzer.ipynb makes plots relevant to the scalar field and mass parameter

-------

Double_Null_utils.py contains the functions that the Double Null codes use

Boundary_Functions.py contains the functions that the Analytical codes use
